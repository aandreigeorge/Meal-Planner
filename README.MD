Stage 6 Description

Description
Meal planning is only half of the job: we also need to be sure that we have all ingredients! In this stage, the program should
generate a shopping list that contains the required ingredients for meals. If several meals require one ingredient, put it in the 
list only once in the following format: ingredient xN, where N is how many times we need this ingredient.

Finally, let's add the option of saving the list as a file. Add the save command to the menu. Save the shopping list to a file and
print an appropriate message. Don't forget to ask users for the file name.
